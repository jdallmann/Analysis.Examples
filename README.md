Data Analysis Examples
==========

This repository contains some examples of data analyses that I have performed  to highlight different aspects of modeling.

## Mpg and transmission type
- This analysis looks at the 1974 *Motor Trend* data from the `mtcars` dataset in R's `datasets` package.
- The dataset's documentation is available [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).
- It attempts to find out whether transmission type affects fuel consumption. To do this it finds the best multiple regression model of miles per gallon in terms of transmission type and other variables that is in line with the assumptions of multiple linear regression.
