Data Analysis Examples
==========

This repository contains some examples of data analyses that I have performed  to highlight different aspects of modeling.

## Mpg and transmission type
- This analysis looks at the 1974 *Motor Trend* data from the `mtcars` dataset in R's `dataset` package.
- The data set's documentation is available [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).
- It attempts to construct the best linear model of miles per gallon (mpg) in terms of transmission and other variables, that is in line with the assumptions of linear regression.
